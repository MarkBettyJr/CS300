# CS300

  This file is the last work required to complete CS300 at SNHU. The date is 2/27/2022. Through this course I learned alot about data types and best practices in codeing using c++. I learned how different data types and search methods can increase/ decrease memory utilization and reduce or increase scan times. I learned more and more about how important documentation is.
  The approach to this course and its two major project I took was to document the information I learned leading up to the final projects and use it a base work to complete the larger projects. Why reinvent the wheel, when I can reuse proven code just modified for the current problem. Making sure to cite the reused code. This course was challenging. I leveraged chat forums and my peers, along with repeated emails with the instructor to overcome many challenges.
  Through out this course I learned that it is incredibly important to document what you are doing, and why. This will help you in the future, and anyone else required to maintain your code. I learned that I need to validate data comming into my code. This was a fun and challenging Class.
